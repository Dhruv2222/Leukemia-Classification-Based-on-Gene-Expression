# Leukemia-Classification-Based-on-Gene-Expression
## Introduction:
In the evolving domain of biomedical research, the application of machine learning has ushered in a paradigm shift. Leveraging computational techniques, researchers are now able to analyze and interpret vast volumes of data to draw significant insights, especially in cancer research. This research specifically delves into the molecular classification of leukemia based on gene expression patterns. The intricate nature of genes and their manifestation in various diseases, particularly leukemia, necessitates a comprehensive and precise analytical approach. Our project undertakes this challenge by employing an ensemble classification model. While our initial inclination was towards a singular kNN classification model, our explorative approach encouraged us to expand our scope to include multiple classification models. This ensured an extensive assessment, fostering optimal results. The intent was not only to achieve accuracy but also to understand the nuanced behavior of various models in predicting gene expressions linked to leukemia. Through this research, we aim to furnish a robust predictive tool that can aid in the timely and accurate diagnosis of leukemia types, potentially informing treatment strategies and enhancing patient outcomes.

## Problem Statement:
The objective of this research is to construct an ensemble machine learning model that can accurately classify and distinguish between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) based on their gene expression patterns. This classification aims to provide a more timely and precise diagnostic tool that can potentially inform appropriate treatment strategies, thereby improving patient outcomes in the realm of leukemia care.
